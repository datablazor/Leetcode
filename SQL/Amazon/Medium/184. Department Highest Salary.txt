Problem: 184. Department Highest Salary

The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, a salary, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
| 2  | Jim   | 90000  | 1            |
| 3  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 4  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 5  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who have the highest salary in each of the departments. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Jim      | 90000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation: Max and Jim both have the highest salary in the IT department and Henry has the highest salary in the Sales department.

Solution 1:

SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary AS Salary
FROM Department AS d JOIN Employee AS e ON d.Id = e.DepartmentId
WHERE (Salary, d.id) IN (SELECT MAX(Salary), DepartmentId FROM Employee 
                         GROUP BY DepartmentId);

--------------------------------------------------------
Solution 2:

SELECT D.Name AS Department, E.Name AS Employee, E.Salary 
FROM Employee E, (SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId) T, Department D
WHERE E.DepartmentId = T.DepartmentId AND E.Salary = T.max AND E.DepartmentId = D.id

--------------------------------------------------------
Solution 3:

SELECT D.Name, A.Name, A.Salary FROM Employee A, Department D   
WHERE A.DepartmentId = D.Id AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Employee B WHERE B.Salary > A.Salary AND A.DepartmentId = B.DepartmentId) 

--------------------------------------------------------
Solution 4:

SELECT D.Name AS Department ,E.Name AS Employee ,E.Salary 
from Employee E, Department D 
WHERE E.DepartmentId = D.id AND (DepartmentId,Salary) in (SELECT DepartmentId,max(Salary) as max FROM Employee GROUP BY DepartmentId)
