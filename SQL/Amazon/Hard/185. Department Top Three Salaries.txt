Problem: 185. Department Top Three Salaries

The Employee table holds all employees. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the department Id.

+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
| 1  | Joe   | 85000  | 1            |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
| 5  | Janet | 69000  | 1            |
| 6  | Randy | 85000  | 1            |
| 7  | Will  | 70000  | 1            |
+----+-------+--------+--------------+
The Department table holds all departments of the company.

+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |
| 2  | Sales    |
+----+----------+
Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).

+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
Explanation:

Solution 1:

SELECT d.Name AS Department, e.Name AS Employee, e.Salary FROM Employee AS e
JOIN Department d ON e.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.Salary) FROM Employee e1
WHERE e1.Salary > e.Salary AND e1.DepartmentId = e.DepartmentId) < 3
ORDER BY d.Name, e.Salary DESC;

---------------------------------------------------------------
Solution 2:

SELECT
    d.Name AS 'Department', e1.Name AS 'Employee', e1.Salary
FROM
    Employee e1
        JOIN
    Department d ON e1.DepartmentId = d.Id
WHERE
    3 > (SELECT
            COUNT(DISTINCT e2.Salary)
        FROM
            Employee e2
        WHERE
            e2.Salary > e1.Salary
                AND e1.DepartmentId = e2.DepartmentId
        );

---------------------------------------------------------------
Solution 3:

Select dep.Name as Department, emp.Name as Employee, emp.Salary from Department dep, 
Employee emp where emp.DepartmentId=dep.Id and 
(Select count(distinct Salary) From Employee where DepartmentId=dep.Id and Salary>emp.Salary)<3

---------------------------------------------------------------
Solution 4:

select Dept.name as Department, Sub.name as Employee, Sub.salary as Salary from

(select dense_rank() over (partition by departmentid order by salary desc) as rank,
 id, name, salary, departmentid from employee) Sub

inner join Department Dept on Sub.departmentid = Dept.id
where rank<4
