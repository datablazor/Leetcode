+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |

product_id is the primary key of this table.
Table: Sales

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |

| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+------ ------+---------+
This table has no primary key, it can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key to Product table.
 

Write an SQL query that reports the buyers who have bought S8 but not iPhone. Note that S8 and iPhone are products present in the Product table.

The query result format is in the following example:

Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+

Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 1          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 3        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| buyer_id    |
+-------------+
| 1           |
+-------------+
The buyer with id 1 bought an S8 but didn't buy an iPhone. The buyer with id 3 bought both.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution 1:

SELECT DISTINCT s.buyer_id FROM Sales AS s
JOIN Product AS p ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.buyer_id
HAVING SUM(p.product_name='S8') > 0 AND SUM(p.product_name = 'iPhone') = 0;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Solution 2:

SELECT buyer_id FROM Sales JOIN Product USING(product_id)
GROUP BY buyer_id
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN product_name = 'S8' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
AND SUM(CASE WHEN product_name = 'iPhone' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Solution 3:

select distinct buyer_id
from sales join product using(product_id)
where product_name = 'S8' 
and buyer_id not in (select distinct buyer_id
                    from sales join product using(product_id)
                    where product_name = 'iPhone' )
